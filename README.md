Tzar: The Burden of the Crown is a real-time strategy game for the PC published by Take-Two Interactive and developed by the Bulgarian game developer company Haemimont Games. It was released March 31, 2000 in the West. The game was met with moderate success; however, it got mild recognition and audience when it was published as a demo in several gaming magazines.

The game was considered by Linux Game Publishing to be ported to Linux, it was however rejected due to concerns within the company about its gameplay and after hearing negative comments about the game from the Linux gaming community.
